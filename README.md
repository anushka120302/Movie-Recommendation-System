# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is made with the help of machine learning. Here I have used the content based recommendation, i.e., using tags.
In this project I made each movie a vector and tried to find the similarity between them and the less the distance between two vectors in a large dimensional space was, the more was it similar.
This is a completely working app on a dataset of around 5000 movies, it uses streamlit and is deployed to heroku cloud platform.
